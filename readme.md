### HTML templates for common http error pages
We don't need readme here, so take some info about error codes:

When accessing a web server or application, every HTTP request that is received by a server is responded to with an HTTP status code. HTTP status codes are three-digit codes, and are grouped into five different classes. The class of a status code can be quickly identified by its first digit:
* 1xx: Informational
* 2xx: Success
* 3xx: Redirection
* 4xx: Client Error
* 5xx: Server Error
